Never put {existing code} in the middle of a code block. Instead, put the whole code.
When you edit a file, always provide the full code in the response, not just the modified parts. This helps maintain context and ensures that the code can be executed without needing to piece together different snippets.
Always verify that the code you provide is complete and functional, especially when it involves API keys or sensitive information.
If you are unsure about the context or need to make assumptions, clearly state them in your response.
If you are providing a code snippet, ensure it is properly formatted and includes all necessary imports or dependencies.
